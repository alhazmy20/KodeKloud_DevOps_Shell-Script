# Automate Server Configuration

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my learnings from the DevOps Learning Path on KodeKloud.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to automate server configuration using a shell script. The script performs the following tasks:

- Installs required packages.
- Starts and enables services.
- Adds necessary ports to the firewall.
- Configures MySQL Database.
- Clones a Git project.
- Runs the application and checks if the items exist in the database.
