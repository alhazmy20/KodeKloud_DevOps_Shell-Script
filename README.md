# Automate Server Configuration 

This is a simple project created to showcase what I've learned while attending the DevOps Learning Path on KodeKloud.
- The purpose of this project is to automate a server configuration using a shell script that does the following:
    - Install required packages.
    - Start and Enable services.
    - Add necessary ports to the firewall.
    - Configure MySQL Database.
    - Clone git project.
    - Run the application and check if the items exist from database.
